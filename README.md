> Serpiente is an online game built with a React front-end and a Rails back-end, with the intent of re-creating the famous snake arcade game with a little twist.  For the young gamers that aren't familiar with the game called snake.  The concept of Serpiente, is for the player uses the arrow keys on the keyboard to move the &#34;snake&#34; around the board. As the snake finds food, it eats the food, and thereby grows larger. The game ends when the snake either moves off the screen or runs into itself. Good Luck and I bet you can't beat our high score!
